# Automated Brain Tumor Classification via CNNs
## Overview:
## This project classifies MRI brain scans into four categories using a convolutional neural network (CNN):

## Glioma Tumor
## Meningioma Tumor
## No Tumor
## Pituitary Tumor
### The model assists in brain tumor diagnosis by identifying the type of tumor present in MRI images.

# Project Structure
## Notebook: AutomatedBrainTumorClassificationviaCNNs.ipynb - all code from data processing to evaluation.
## README.md: Project instructions and documentation.
# Key Steps
### Data Preprocessing: Images are augmented and loaded from Train and Test directories for each class.
### Model Architecture: A CNN with convolutional, max-pooling, and dropout layers for multi-class classification.
### Training & Evaluation: Model performance is visualized using accuracy/loss plots and a confusion matrix.
### Testing: Predicts tumor types on new images to verify real-world applicability.

# Results
### Plots and a confusion matrix provide insights into model performance.
